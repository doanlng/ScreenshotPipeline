This is a project from codementor that does the following :

    Create a webpage with any technology you want (a simple create-*-app can suffice) or use a webpage you already have or an open source project you can easily fork
    Create a script that takes a screenshot of the webpage.
    Set up a trigger to take a new screenshot every time you commit to the main branch of the repo
    Note that the screenshot should be taken by code running in the CI/CD environment, not on your own machine; you want the screenshot to look just like production
    Include that screenshot in your README to show off.
    From now on, your README should always display an up-to-date screenshot of your webpage without any other manual intervention other than pushing to the main branch
